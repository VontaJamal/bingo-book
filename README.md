# Bingo Book 📓

**Rank every anime you've ever watched. No exceptions.**

The Bingo Book is where you put your anime on record. Grade every series you've seen from F to S, lock in your Mt. Rushmore (top 4, carved in stone, not debatable), and let the world see where you stand.

## What It Does

- **Mt. Rushmore** — Your top 4 anime. Period. These are your GOATS. Carved in stone, no takebacks.
- **Full Rankings** — Every anime you've watched gets a grade. F through S. No mercy, no participation trophies.
- **Your Profile** — Public page showing your Rushmore, your grades, your taste. Own it.
- **Compare** — See how your rankings stack up against others. Find out who has trash taste.
- **Community** — Debate, argue, defend your picks. If Naruto isn't in your Rushmore, explain yourself.

## The Grading Scale

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **S** | Masterpiece. Changed you as a person. |
| **A** | Elite. You'd rewatch it tomorrow. |
| **B** | Solid. Respected but not worshipped. |
| **C** | Mid. It existed and you watched it. |
| **D** | Below mid. You finished it out of spite. |
| **F** | Regret. You want those hours back. |

## The Mt. Rushmore Rules

1. Exactly 4 anime. Not 3, not 5. Four.
2. Once carved, you can change it. But everyone sees the edit history. Your flip-flopping is public record.
3. You must be able to defend every pick. If you can't, you don't deserve the Rushmore.

## Status

Early development. The foundation is being laid.
